## Last Weeks's Accomplishments
- Finished draft and had it implemented its static version in `html` and `css`
- Figured out how to use `javascript`/`jquery` to alter web content.
## This Week's Plan
- Learn how to load course data from `json` files into web page.
- Further polish the draft with other frontend team members
## Things in the way (a.k.a. "risks")
- technical
  - `javascript` might be easy to learn, but is hard to master
  - we still don't have a server to deploy the system, though that's not gonna matter too much at this point
- others
  - deadlines from other courses e.g. Programming Languages
  - it takes time and patience to mentor non-major students
