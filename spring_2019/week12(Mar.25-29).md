# Work Done

- database integration: finished the python part that allows flask to interact with the database
  - data loading code that loads json files, parse them and loads them into database
  - adaptor that allows sql queries
- github project page for this semester's presentation

# Plans for this week

- implement the feature that allows users to change color scheme (issue #13)
- get the web link issue fixed (might take more than a week)

# Obstacles

- i'm still not very comfortable with the psycopg2 api used for database integration
