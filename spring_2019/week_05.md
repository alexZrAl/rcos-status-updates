## Last Weeks Accomplishments:
- Finished implementing the advanced "search by keyowrd" functionality, now one can search "datastructures" by only typing "datas"
- More studying on regex and string matching algo (e.g. KMP)

## This week's plan:
- Implement a cookie-free version of page jumping
- Tweak search result page so it displays appripriate message for different edge cases (such as no matching result)

## Obstacles:
- Existing code from last semester are starting to look messy, and different to refactor / add new functionalities
