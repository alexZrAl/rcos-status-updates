## Progress since last update

- Web code refactored with flask and tested on a remote linux server

## Current plans

- further understand the database system we are working with, especially how to manage users and establishing a schema that is efficient and not redundant.
- reproduce and fix the bug where server receives bad http request when I visited the deployed website (see image below)
