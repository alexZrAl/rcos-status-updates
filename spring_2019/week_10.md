## Work done

- Fixed the HTTP-400 bug mentioned in the last status update.

## current plans

- Fix broken columns in our current data, or potentially migrate to a new plotting lib that tolerates with the missing columns.
- Categorize stored courses so they can be searched by inputs that are not course name.
  - search by department, course id, professor... maybe student drop-out ratio?
  - allow users to perform searches mentioned above with only a single search bar (this functionality is still being discusses)
  
## obstacles

- we might need to redesign our schema for courses
