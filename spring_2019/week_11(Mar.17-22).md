# Work done

- Fixed "invalid column" error on some parts of the data.
- Data is now ready to be loaded into a database, and accessed with sql stmts.

# Current Plans

- Complete the process of using database, instead of plain json files for data.
- Sort out documentation (finish missing status updates, set up github project page for the next mile stone)

# Obstacles

- we need a way to allow users to access the site by using an actual web link, not a cryptic(from the user's perspective) ip address.
