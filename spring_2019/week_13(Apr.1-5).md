# Work done
- learned how to efficiently use psycopg2 for database integration
- color scheme design, values stored on the server side as configuration files

# Plans for this week
- misc. debugging & fixing
- Most of this week will be focused on dealing with exams / deadlines so team members do not fail their courses.
- Once exams & ddls finish:
  - Finish the part where the css file gets updated according to a selected color scheme configuration
  - Wrap things up, clean up the repo and prepare for final presentation

# Obstacles (non-technicals included)
- This week is a busy week for most of the team members, we cannot have enough time on the project in this week.
