## Work Done

- Final presentation
- Ambiguous search (50%)

## Plans for this week

- Finish the remaining parts of ambiguous search. Mainly using the hints to obtain the actual course info, and redirecting user to the corresponding page.
- Complete documentations.
  - issue & PR templates
  - guide (maybe put this on the repo wiki page?) for new rcos members to get used to rcos traditions (status updates, stand-ups, ...)

## Obstacles

- Server firewall is still blocking requests sent to the database server. We might have to put data on the server instead of another place.
