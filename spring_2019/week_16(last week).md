# Work Done

- contribution templates, guides

# Plans for this (and summer break) weeks

- (Priority) Establish VPN access so members of the team can continue working even when physically in mainland China.
- Clean up old server code.
- Continue work on new features, for example, allow multiple ways of representing data, and comparing between professors.

# Obstacles

- I'm not sure if members of the team can pick up the work after being hammered by their finals.
- On ~Apr.22, authorities in mainland China blocked access to all wikipedia sites (previously only zh.wikipedia is blocked). We are not sure when github will suffer the same fate, and we certainly need a contingency plan.
- From my understanding so far, whether a VPN service (no matter self-built or purchased) can provide access to sites blocked in mainland China is random is random.
